# Choreography-based Saga Pattern: Data consistency in Microservices

This is a transaction management sample solution that demonstrates how to maintain data consistency across services in a microservices architecture by using [Saga](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html) pattern.

Services are implemented through choreography-based sagas, which means that all participants are loosely coupled as they don't have direct knowledge of each other. Participants 'simply' subscribe to each otherâ€™s events and respond accordingly.
